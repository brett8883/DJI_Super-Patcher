# DJI Super-Patcher 2.0.1 updates

- No major changes 
- Swapped the executable file out for a batch file instead. The executable file was being falsely flagged as malicious software by anti-virus software because it was unsigned.
- Added documentation about the 5000m waypoint limit being removed with Super-Patcher

  *- NOTE: This is NOT a new feature. It has always been enabled on all versions of Super-Patcher but was never documented*

# DJI Super-Patcher

Super-Patcher now supports the following aircraft and firmwares:

- Mavic Pro/Mavic Pro Platinum/Mavic Pro Alpine White V01.04.0300

- Spark V01.00.0900

- Phantom 4 Pro V01.05.0600

- Phantom 4 standard V2.00.0700

- Phantom 4 advanced V1.00.0128

- Phantom 4 ProV2 V01.00.1500

- Inspire 2 V01.02.0200

## OBJECTIVE SUMMARY

This package is for installing a custom flight controller for:

- ***Mavic Pro,Mavic Pro Platinum, or MP Alpine White*** running a 100% stock version of the v01.04.0300 firmware.

- ***Spark*** running a 100% stock version of the v01.00.0900 firmware.

- ***Phantom 4 Professional*** running a 100% stock version of the v1.05.0600 firmware.

- ***Phantom 4 advanced*** running a 100% sotock version of the v1.00.0128 firmware.

- ***Phantom 4 Standard*** running a 100% stock version of the v2.00.0700 firmware.

- ***Phantom 4 ProV2*** running a 100% stock version of the V01.00.1500 firmware.

- ***Inspire 2*** running a 100% stock version of the V01.02.0200 firmware. 

The purpose of this project is to liberate DJI aircraft from the limitations imposed by DJI. DJI Super-Patcher allows new features/abilities, unlocks arbutrary limitations, and allows DJI aircraft to be customized far beyond what is allowed by the factory firmware.

Super-Patcher works differently than other methods for unlocking firmware. It is not a modification that mixes old firmware with new firmware. Super-Patchers patches the flight controller module that is already installed on your aircraft. This ability to patch the actual firmware itself means that new capabilities are unlocked. Super-Patcher has been tested and verified. You can trust that it has been proven but you still use at your own risk. 

While Super-Patcher removes the default altitude and GeoZone limitation it is solely the resposibility of the pilot to ensure local laws and regulations are adhered to just like anyother aircraft.

**BENEFITS SUMMARY**

*(PLEASE READ THE DETAILED LIST THAT FOLLOWS AS WELL)*

- Remove height limitations
- Remove NFZ and GeoZone limits
- Enable Galileo satellite reception
- No motors errors on Mavic Pro Platinum
- Does NOT require an internal SD card be installed
- Precision RTH and Precision Landing will work normally
- Optionally enable slower more cinematic panning (yaw) speed
- Optionally enable full time FCC or boost mode with jkson_fcc_mod by jkson5 built in (Mavic, Spark***(NEW!)***, and P4PV2 Only)

***************************************************************************************************************************
**Please carefully read through the through explanation of the benefits below. Directions to get started will follow**
***************************************************************************************************************************

# ***Features of Super-Patcher***

### Remove height limitations by default

- There is nothing additional the user needs to do to enable this feature and it is always enabled.

- As soon as the Super-Patcher process is complete the drone will ignore ALL height limitations even if set by the user in DJI Go 4.

  -Even though the user is able to enter a value in for height limit in DJI Go 4, the drone WILL NOT obey this hight limit command.

    - **Please fly with caution!**

- *This is not optional and is hard-coded into the firmware. There will be no height limit parameters visable in Assistant 2*

- To enable height limits again would require uninstalling Super-Patcher which can be done simply by flashing to a stock firmware version

- Please note that the height limit parameters in Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode will NOT be visable beacuse they are hard-coded to the firmware. These parameters have been modified to disable height limit altogether even though they are not visable.  

     ***It is always the responsibility of the pilot to fly safely and to know local regulations.***

***************************************************************************************************************************

### Remove NFZ and GeoZone limits by default

  There is nothing additional the user needs to do to enable this feature and it is always enabled.

- As soon as the Super-Patcher process is complete the drone will ignore all forced GeoZone and NFZ limitations

  - **This is not an optional and is hard coded into the firmware.**

- Please note:

  - GeoZones will still be marked in the app and the app will still warn you when the drone is close to or in an NFZ,

  howeverâ€¦

    - Your drone will not be prevented from flying

    - Your drone will not be forced to auto-land.

    - You drone will not be preventing from taking off

      - **Please fly with caution!**

- The airport limit parameters are hard-coded and will not be visible in Assistant 2. Airport limits have already been disabled. These parameters have been modified to disable airport limits altogether even though they are not visible.

    **It is always the responsibility of the pilot to fly safely and to know local regulations.**
***************************************************************************************************************************
### Unlocks the limit for waypoint missions

- DJI has limited the length of waypoint missions to 5000 meters on factory firmware. Super-Patcher raises the limit to 128000 meters

*NOTE: A third party app such as Litchi may be needed to upload waypoint missions longer than 5000m. The way the DJI Go 4 app is set up it may not allow a mission greater than 5000m to be uploaded to the aircraft regardless of the firmware limit being removed.*
***************************************************************************************************************************

### Enable Galileo satellite reception by default

- The drone will now connect to Galileo GPS satellites in addition to the satellites already available. This means you can expect to see a greater satellite count in the app and a stronger, more reliable, and more accurate GPS signal.

- There is nothing additional the user needs to do to enable it and it is always enabled.

- Typically you can expect to see your sat count at between 20-30 satellites once they have all connected

***************************************************************************************************************************

### Does NOT require an internal SD card be installed

- With older methods for unlocking, namely mixed firmware mods, the Mavic Pro Platinum and some more recently manufactured Mavic Pros required that the Mavic be opened and an internal SD card installed for other mods to work. **NOT** with Super-Patcher. Super-Patcher does **NOT** require an internal SD card because it is **NOT** a mixed firmware modification.
***************************************************************************************************************************

### No motors errors on Mavic Pro Platinum

- With older modification techniques, namely mixed firmware mods, the Mavic Pro Platinum will give motor errors due to not having the correct ESC modules for the upgraded MPP ESCs

- Because Super-Patcher modifies the flight controller on v01.04.0300 firmware which has the correct ESC modules for Mavic Pro AND Mavic Pro Platinum there will be no motor errors and ESCs will work as designed

***************************************************************************************************************************

### Precision RTH and Precision Landing are not affected and will work normally**

- With older methods for removing height limits and NFZ limits, namely mixed firmware mods, the precision RTH and precision landing features did not function as expected.

- Because Super-Patcher is not a mixed firmware mod it does **NOT** affect these functions and so they will work as expected.

***************************************************************************************************************************
  **Motors will restart when aircraft is inverted**

- By default the aircraft will allow the motors to be restarted even if the aircraft is inverted. This parameter is hardcoded and will not be visable in Assistant 2. One can remove the props and hold the aircraft upside down and then arm the motors with a CSC to verify this parameter is working.

- Note: This also means the motors cannot be turned off by turning it upside down. When hand catching use the free hand to push down on the throttle stick (left stick in RC type 2) to turn off the motors when hand catching.
***************************************************************************************************************************
## **OPTIONAL FEATURES**

### SMART BATTERY MOD
***Super-Patcher unlocks the DJI Smart Battery to its full potential making it 100% customizable.***
 - Say goodbye to "non-DJI battery mode!"
   - Fully customize the DJI Smart battery behavior and take back ownership of your aircraft
   - Smart battery mod can be custom configured by the user in Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode or be pre-configured by Super-Patcher
    - NOTE: Default parameters for DJI Smart Battery remain factory default unless "YES" is selected by the user during the Super-Patcher process to have the Smart Battery pre-configured by Super-Patcher

   **Super-Patcher pre-configured battery mod option**
     - Disable Forced Auto-Landing due to Smart Battery low battery
      -*NOTE:* A final "emergency auto-landing" will only occur at the emergency low voltage level which is at 3.0v per cell (well below the safe voltage to fly.) This can also be disabled in Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode.  
     - Re-calibrated Smart Battery "Only enough battery remaining to return to the home point" calculation to be more accurate
      - Can be further customized by the user in Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode

    - Disable low battery warning when using DJI Smart Battery
     - Can be reenabled in Assistant 2 or set at any battery percentage level
    - Disabled critical low battery warning when using DJI Smart Battery
     - Can be reenabled in Assistant 2 or set at any battery percentage level

These options can be enabled in Assistant 2 1.1.2 ***OR*** they can be enabled by AUTOMATICALLY by indicating "YES" during the Super-Patcher process.

***NOTE: The Smart Battery modifications can also be disabled or tweaked to user preference in Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode***

***FWIW: The Smart Battery Mod is a modification to how the aircraft responds to input from the Smart Battery. It is not a modification TO the Smart Battery***

***FURTHER DOCUMENTATION FOR SMART BATTERY MOD COMING SOON***

### STEALTH MOD
The new Stealth modification will disable the rear LED lights on the aircraft which will remain OFF during flight for Super Stealthy flight.

- The Stealth modification is optional but it is hard-coded into the firmware and cannot be changed by the user in flight or with Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode
  NOTE: To undo the Stealth mod, simply run Super-Patcher again without the Stealth mod selected or download and flash stock firmware from the MainMenu

   **Optionally customize parameters with Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode**

- Just like any other firmware you can use Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode to turn up the max speed parameters, enable ATTI mode, or virtually endless parameter modifications

- For more information on some of the available parameter mods see [howto:parameterhacks](https://dji.retroroms.info/howto/parameterhacks)
These are optional

***************************************************************************************************************************

## Optionally enable slower more cinematic panning motions for more cinematic video.**

- Enables setting yaw speed to as low as 1 degree per second in any mode using Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode or directly in DJI Go 4 for P-GPS mode to get much smoother and slower cinematic pans.

  - By default yaw speeds are factory default

- Each flight mode has its own yaw speed parameter that can be changed in Assistant 2 1.1.2 in debug mode. The value these parameters is in degrees per second

     ***The parameters for yaw speed for each mode are:***

    - **P-GPS** *mode with front OA sensors ON*

          g_config_avoid_cfg_avoid_tors_rate_range

    - **P-GPS** *mode with front sensors OFF*

          g_config_mode_normal_cfg_tors_gyro_range


    - **Sport Mode**

          g_config_mode_sport_cfg_tors_gyro_range

    - **Tripod mode**

          g_config_mode_tripod_cfg_tors_gyro_range

    - **Cinematic Mode**

           CM_tors_range

    **These are optional**

***

## Optionally enable full time FCC or FCC boost mode with jkson_fcc_mod by jkson5**

- You will be asked if you'd like to enable jkson_fcc_mod if your aircraft supports it. Jkson_fcc_mod is only availible for Mavic Pro, Mavic Pro Platinum, Mavic Pro Artic White, and P4Pv2

- Jkson mod also allows you to choose between "Auto frequency" (2.4 GHz), fixed 2.3 GHz, and fixed 2.5 GHz.
	- I highly recommend choosing "Auto-frequency"
		- 2.3 GHz and 2.5 GHz might be better in 1% of cases but it is very rare and even if they do work better they are more likely to cut video feed without warning because they are fixed to a single channel.

- You can learn more about jkson fcc mod by jkson5 at https://github.com/jkson5/jkson_fcc_mod

- I am not the developer of this mod so questions about it are better directed to jkson5

- It is included in Super-Patcher because it is a widely used mod and it shares dependancies with Super-Patcher so it made sense to include it for convenience 	

    **This is optional**

## DIRECTIONS

1. Ensure the prerequisites above are met

2. Download or clone the entire repository
  - Be sure to keep all files in original folders

3. Double click the DJI_Super-PatcherV2.0.1.cmd file to start the program

4. Super-Patcher will check internet connection to GitHub which is required and the Windows version of the PC and then download the files it needs to run.

5. At the Super-Patcher MainMenu you get several options and it allows you to use the utilities included in the program independantly of the Super-Patcher process

- Choose option #1 with your keyboard if you already have the correct stock firmware installed for your aircraft. IF you do not have the correct firmware installed you can instead choose option #2 to download and install the correct firmware.

6. After choosing option #1 the program will ask you the optional mods you'd like to install and then will prompt you to turn on your aircraft and connect it to the PC

7. Super-Patcher will guide you through the process from here.

  - **Please do what it says when it says to do it**

    - Follow all the steps even if you think you don't need to do them... **YOU DO!**

    - Don't try to outsmart the process or do anything extra "for good measure"

      - these are the main reasons for Super-Patcher not being successful


8. You will be prompted to verify flight controller version at the end to confirm Super-Patcher is successful

9. You may optionally use the simulator in Assistant 2 or DJI Go 4 to verify working order before testing outside.

- If there are issues with flight in the simulator there will be issues with flight in real life.

  - Re-flash stock firmware and then redo ENTIRE Super-Patcher process in case of an issue.

    - *Please Note: To date there has never been an issue with flight after installing Super-Patcher. This recommendation is only a matter of good practice whenever modifying or flashing firmware*

Done!

  - Process takes maybe 5 minutes

## **FAQ**

*Q: Do I need a specific version of the DJI Go 4 app to get the benefits of this mod?*

**A: No, Super-Patcher is not dependent on an app so you can use any one youâ€™d like.**

*Q: Do I need to do anything with the controller? Like upgrade/downgrade the controller?*

**A: No, Super-Patcher doesnâ€™t do anything with the controller and it makes no difference which controller firmware you are using.**

*Q: There is a parameter called g_config_fw_cfg_max_speed=10 that increased the max flight speed and I was told to increase this to 20 so I can fly faster but when I try to adjust this parameter in Assistant 2 it reverts back to 10 when I reboot the aircraft. How to I change this parameter so I can increase flight speed?*

**A. The parameter** g_config_fw_cfg_max_speed=10 **does not affect flight speed. The parameters that control max flight speed end with** "_cfg_tilt_atti_range" **and** "_cfg_rc_scale"**each mode has a parameter like this that will adjust the max speed in each mode. g_config_fw_cfg_max_speed=10 was misidentified and some point in the past as a max flight speed parameter but it is not. I do not know what it does but I know it does not affect max flight speed. On the newer firmware this parameter is hardcoded but still visible in Assistant 2 1.1.2 so it will seemingly change in Assistant 2 1.1.2 but in reality it will not let you change it. As far as I am concerned nobody knows what this parameters does.**   

*Q: Is it worth trying this in my Mavic 2? Any idea when Mavic 2 will be available?*

**A: Super-Patcher has zero chance of working on the Mavic 2 at this time. We need a decryption key for Mavic 2â€™s firmware and a way to gain adb access. Both of those things are above my pay grade**
